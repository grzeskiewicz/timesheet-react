# Timesheet React
Timesheet Project - frontend created in ReactJS. To try it out:

1. Just git clone
2. npm install
3. npm start\

Database has a test user added with admin role: test@test.com, password: test. After logging in hit "Utw√≥rz listy" to make sure app won't crash (normally there is a script creating new timesheet once every month on backend side).
